# Conventional Commits Rules

## 5 General Rules for writing a standard git commit message

-  The description should tell why, NOT how you made the change.
-  Do not end the description with a period.
-  Write the description in the imperative form, for example, "Fix a bug," NOT "Fixed a bug," "Fixes a bug," or "Fixing a bug."
-  Wrap each line in the body after 72 characters.
-  If your commit message has a body, separate the body and the subject line using a blank line.
